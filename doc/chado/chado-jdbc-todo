if retrieving a seq/range that is out of range - the operations goes
ahead - ends up with an empty sequence and then thows an exception is

dashed yellow result lines for game adapter results - need that in
chado as well (eg LD10168:contig1 in cact) (LD08295:contig1/contig2 in
heix) - somehow contigs are getting lumped into one result set
presently adapter lumps spans into sets via names - contig feat set
spans have different names
[waiting on resultset featlocs]

result feats part of result 'transcript' that is out of range not
being retrieved - should they be? yes
[waiting on resultset featlocs]

i'm noticing some slight oddities in tier layout when i load with the
chado adapter.  they're reminiscent of the layout problems that we saw
with suzi's recent attempt to fix an obscure tier bug (some of the tiers
looked partially collapsed, even though they were supposed to be
expanded).  suzi has reverted that fix to how it was, and the tier layout
now looks fine when i load from the game adapter, but if i load cact from
chado, the tier just above the purple ones appears to have mixed dark
green, bright green, and (strangely) light green (the EST color).  the
weirdest thing is that if i try to select the light green results,
they're not really there--they don't appear in the detail panel list.
the light green EST tier also appears to have dark green results mixed
in/overlayed, and again, you can't seem to click on them.
SD03793:contig1
LD08295:contig1 (in heix gene)
problem is spans from different result sets with same name

null pointer on chado adapter gui (initial load from command line,

Change queries to use featureslice function. actually featureslice
function doesnt deal with overlap - write new function that deals with overlap.

If you select an annotation from the Annotations menu, the name in the
bottom colored label of the detail panel is incorrect (it's the name of a
different annotation). 
I think the problem here is that proteins (-PA) slipped into annot menu and
i dont think they should be in there. works fine for transcripts.

get feat prop descriptions on demand - slows up hit query

try out the other 2 indiana servers (leave them in config for public?)


get annot owner colors working - need to query for owner - not sure
where that is in schema

examine how much description retrieval slows things down (also seq retrieval)

make genomic seq lazy

merge sim4 and blastx masked queries - be able to put multiple
programs in addSearchHits?

add laziness option for retrieving target seqs

sort out/refactor/merge/rename Sequence and GAMESequence and
AbstractSequence - put range stuff as optional stuff in AbstractSequence?

do history per database - this also means changing history on changing
databases (new ground but should be easy)
-- for sequence have the history be database-seqtype specific, where
   it would change history on either changing db or seq type

adapter gui needs to recover from sql exceptions - just hangs now

query by location

cyto query - not featureloc'd - feature relationship - see shu/cjm
email on how to retrieve this

should target seqs be cached? presently there are 2 made if 2 feats
hit the same target 

Config all the things we say need configging - theres a bunch
where to config - probably the style file:
CFG1) feature loc implementation
CFG3) should stuff in chado_adapter.cfg migrate to style?
CFG4) seq types to query on (top level feature) in chado adapter
gui (tigr:assembly,super-contig fb:gene, golden_path_region
CFG4b) need to config seq types display label - eg golden_path_region so
type needs to be displayed as "scaffold" 
CFG5)tigr and fb have different ways of doing feature types - config
this?
CFG6) analysis feature column to use for score
CFG9) config padding of queries (eg gene 5 kb padding in fb)
CFG10) all the stuff in getCurationSet() needs to be configged

gene query needs to pad out 5 kb - config

Merge configging of database (conf/chado-adapter.cfg) into apollo.cfg?
(or style?)

Make database config in chado-adapter.cfg tag value like tiers file:
[Database]
  label : "Chado Cryptococcus database (chado_crypt)"    
  jdbcdriver : "apollo.dataadapter.chado.jdbc.SybaseChadoAdapter"
  jdbcserver : "jdbc:sybase:Tds:dbserver.tigr.org:2025"
  server-database(?): "chado_crypt"
  feature-filter : "%neoformans%"
  [login :  "flybase"]
  [password :  ""]
[Database]
  jdbcdriver : jdbcdriverwithspecsprovidedbyuser
....

Add optional password to db config file.

chromosome not coming in from fb adapter

put in all the history in gui with drop down lists (excluding password
of course)

Get golden_path_region list doesnt work

Exception on expanding transcript in annot tree in annot info:
java.lang.NullPointerException
        at apollo.datamodel.Exon.outsideOfRegion(Exon.java:66)
        at apollo.datamodel.Exon.toString(Exon.java:73)
        at javax.swing.tree.DefaultMutableTreeNode.toString(DefaultMutableTreeNode.java:1229)

have features appear as they are loaded - this would be awesome! and i
dont think it will be too hard

refactor description property

Window title includes chromosome but not range--e.g. if you load cact, it
says 2L; should say 2L:16266113-16329185.

LOWER PRIORITY

annot info:
finished - crp has it checked in game not jdbc - actually its checked
in gadfly but not r3.2 - hmmmm - not sure if its in chado then - dont
think it is - not in feat props

CT14888 (release2 annot - blue) in AE003689 result seq is peptide
spaced - not so in game adapter

config gene padding? put in adapter gui?

sequence query - needs blast script

revisit cds query stuff

cds and gene are bringing in sequence - do it on demand optionally?
check this i dont think they actually have sequence in fb chado

adapter gui:
take out custom db prompt by default - power user can config it back
in if they want
coupled with that - take out jdbc driver and url and chado driver
class by default as well as things the user doesnt need to see?

do we need the sequence field in the adapter gui? - i think its for
list retrieval

class apollo.dataadapter.chado.ChadoAdapter: warning - failed to read
/users/nomi/apollo/conf/chado-adapter.cfg - happens for me not crabber

gene predictions dont have analysis tier in data model - does it need
it? synteny is the only reason i can think of off hand that relies on
tier level feature set - and gene predictions arent involed in synteny
at this point- is there other reasons im missing - i thought it caused
transcript lines to happen - so i put it in for search hits - but i
was wrong
probably should as its causing the label in the evidence panel to be
numbered for all gene predics - not separately for each program - see
FlyDisplayPrefs.getBioTypeForDisplay 

on failing to find kripke got exceptions - should make more graceful:
