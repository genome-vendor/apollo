This apollo/doc directory was reorganized in 4/2007, primarily for
the purposes of creating a set of READMEs and moving all bugs 
and enhancement requests to the Apollo Sourceforge tracker.

No information was lost. The history of fixed bugs is
described in the release-notes/old-fixed-bugs,
release-notes/1.4.0-1.6.5-fixed-bugs, and
release-notes/1.36-1.5.4-synteny-fixed-bugs files.
