These are notes on data issues, not Apollo bugs but problems due to
missing or incorrect input to Apollo. 


Missing from GAME XML
=============================
A lot of the fields that blast hits should have (such as "identity" and
"expect") are missing from the GAME XML data we get from Indiana (and
also from the Chado XML examples I was given).  This is not an Apollo
bug, but rather a data issue.  [4/13/05: Sima emailed Don about this.]

Sian reported:

Could not delete Cyp6d5-RA from Cyp6d5 because drawable was not found

(She got this same exception over and over--for some reason, in
Comment.clone person was coming in null.  I put in a null pointer check,
but need to figure out why person is null.)

MG: so it turns out the game file sian was using somehow lacked a
person for the person entirely. whats even more mysterious is its
impossible that this came from the game adapter as the game adapter
will print out "null" for person if there isnt one, in other words the
game adapter will always print a comment person, so the source of this
file can not be from the game adapter. this leaves 2 possibilities 1)
C2G or 2) the file somehow got corrupted. both seem unlikely but i
cant see what else it could be. nomis null pointer tolerance at least
makes it so apollo doesnt freak out - and a println warning is
issued. basically its a faulty data issue and it doesnt appear to be
an apollo issue.

Data from Indiana CGI
=======================
If you ask the Indiana cgi for data by chromosome region (e.g.,
2L:10000-20000), you get an entire scaffold that includes the requested
gene or region--not the actual region requested.  According to Victor,
they don't have time to fix this, so it will probably stay that way.

Mismatched coordinates
========================
Chromosome arm coordinates in data from IU Apollo cgi don't match
coordinates from NCBI (so if you try to, for example, take a gene
sequence, BLAST it at NCBI against the chromosomes, and then overlay the
BLAST hits on that region in Apollo, it won't line up right).

BLAST Results in Anopheles data
===========================
BLAST results in Harvard's Anopheles data had spans on both + and -
strands, which led to bad behavior if you tried to create annotations
from those results.
