<p>Defines the interfaces to support the reading of DAS datasources
by Apollo. The goal is allow different implementations to be
provided of, for example, <code>DASServer</code>. These implementations
can be sophisticated or not, as necessary. </p>

<p>I have included a reference (very direct, unsophisticated) implementation
in the <code>apollo.dataadapter.das.simple</code> package.</p>

<p>The interface <code>DASServer</code> is the basic type 
referred to by a data adapter referencing a DAS datasource. The <code>DASDsn</code>,
<code>DASSegment</code>, <code>DASFeature</code> and <code>DASSequence</code> are
types used to pass information into a request from the server, and 
to retrieve information back from the server.</p>
