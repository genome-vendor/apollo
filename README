Apollo is a genome annotation viewer and editor. It was developed as a
collaboration between the Berkeley Drosophila Genome Project (part of
the FlyBase consortium) and The Sanger Institute in Cambridge,
UK. Apollo allows researchers to explore genomic annotations at many
levels of detail, and to perform expert annotation curation, all in a
graphical environment.

This distribution is intended mostly for developers - it does not include
the installer.  If you'd like to install Apollo on your Mac or Windows
machine, please visit http://www.fruitfly.org/annot/apollo/install.html.

For more developer information, see the README files in doc/. For user
documentation see doc/html/userguide.html or go to http://fruitfly.org/apollo.
